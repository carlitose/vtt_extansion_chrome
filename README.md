# VTT Downloader - Chrome Extension

Chrome extension to download VTT files from web pages and save them as .txt files with the page title as filename.

## üì¶ Installation

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `vtt_estensione` folder
5. The extension is now installed!

## üé® Better Icon (Optional)

To create a nicer icon:
1. Open the `create_icon.html` file in a browser
2. The `icon.png` file will be automatically downloaded
3. Replace the icon in the extension folder
4. Reload the extension at `chrome://extensions/`

## üöÄ Usage

1. Go to a web page that contains VTT files (subtitles)
2. Click the extension icon in the toolbar
3. Click the "Download VTT" button
4. The file will be downloaded as `.txt` with the page title as filename

## üîç How It Works

The extension searches for VTT files in this order:

### Primary Method (Network Interception)
1. **Background script monitors network requests** - Intercepts all `.vtt` file requests via Chrome's webRequest API

### Fallback Methods (DOM & Performance API)
2. `<track>` tags (video subtitles)
3. Links with `.vtt` extension
4. `.vtt` URLs in page HTML
5. Blob URLs or Data URLs with VTT files
6. Performance API (resources loaded via XHR/Fetch)

## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Manifest V3** - Uses the latest Chrome extension manifest version
- **Service Worker** - Background script runs as a service worker
- **webRequest API** - Intercepts network requests to capture VTT files
- **Scripting API** - Injects scripts to search DOM and Performance API
- **Downloads API** - Handles file downloads with proper naming

### Why Network Interception?
Modern video players often load subtitles dynamically via XHR/Fetch requests. These files never appear in the page DOM, making them impossible to find through traditional DOM queries. The background script intercepts these network requests to capture VTT file URLs.
